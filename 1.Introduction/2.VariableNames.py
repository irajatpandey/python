# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# 1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# 2. A variable name cannot start with a number
# 3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# 4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# 5. A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# all are valid variable names
myvar = "Jai Shree Ram"
my_var = "Jai Shree Ram"
_my_var = "Jai Shree Ram"
myVar = "Jai Shree Ram"
MYVAR = "Jai Shree Ram"
myvar2 = "Jai Shree Ram"

print(myvar)
print(my_var)
print(_my_var)
print(myVar)
print(MYVAR)
print(myvar2)

# Illegal Variable names
# 2myvar = "Jai Shree Ram"
# my-var = "Jai Shree Ram"
# my var = "Jai Shree Ram"


# Camel Case
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "Jai Shree Ram"
# Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "Jai Shree Ram"
# Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "Jai Shree Ram"
